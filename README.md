# Python-Website-Scraper
Crawl a website and download all the pdf files from it.
In this project I was required to download all the financial reports from Imperial County website. For this I designed this scraper script that crawls the website for available links and then filters the pdf links. 
The next step is to downlaod the pdf files in a directory on local machine.
